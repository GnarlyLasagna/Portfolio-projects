# Invoices React App

Invoices + Frontend Mentor's visual design.

To see the finished app website you can [run it here!](https://invoice-app-fem.netlify.app/).

I created this Invoices app with React as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) challenges

This website gives you challenges that can be in the form of single function web applications, multipage websites or highly complex web apps.
You get reference pictures of how the application or site should look and function and a few svg or images needed to create the project and it is up to you to take these tools and figure out the correct styling, functions, and sizes to put it all together.

## Background

The purpose of this project is two-fold: to create an attractive and functional web application, sharpen my understanding of the React framework and to have a standard Create, Read, Update, Delete application on my portfolio

This module depends upon basic knowledge of [terminal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS).
