# Pomodoro React App

‚è≤ React Pomodoro timer + Frontend Mentor's visual design.

To see the finished app website you can [run it here!](https://pomodora-app-fem.netlify.app/).

I created this [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app with React as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G) challenges

This website gives you challenges that can be in the form of single function web applications, multipage websites or highly complex web apps.
You get reference pictures of how the application or site should look and function and a few svg or images needed to create the project and it is up to you to take these tools and figure out the correct styling, functions, and sizes to put it all together.

## Background

The purpose of this project is two-fold: to create an attractive and functional pomodoro timer, sharpen my understanding of the React framework and add another project to my portfolio

I originally attempted the design in html/css and vanilla JavaScript, but quickly saw the value in using React to track State and render components. That's why this project uses a single css file instead css files for each js file

This module depends upon basic knowledge of [terminal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS).
